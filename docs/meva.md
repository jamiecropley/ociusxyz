# Math Engine: Vector Addition

## 2D

### Math:

$$ c = a + b = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2) $$

$$ a = (4, 2) $$
$$ b = (3, 1) $$

$$ c = a + b = (4 + 3, 2 + 1) $$

$$ c = (7, 3) $$

### C++ Engine Code:

```cpp
// Your First C++ Program

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Test" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```


## 3D

### Math:

$$ d = a + b = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3) $$

$$ a = (8, 12, 8) $$
$$ b = (10, 4, 9) $$


$$ c = a + b = (8 + 10, 12 + 4, 8 + 9) $$

$$ c = (18, 16, 17) $$




### C++ Engine Code:

```cpp
// Your First C++ Program

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Test" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
